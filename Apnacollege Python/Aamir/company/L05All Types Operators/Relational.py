# Relational Operators => ==,!=,>,<,>=,<=
# Relational Operators Return Boolean (True or False)
# Relational Operators are used to compare values

# Relational Operator => Equal (==) not equal to (!=) greater than (>) less than (<) greater than or equal to (>=) less than or equal to (<=)

a = 10
b = 5

print("Equal to Equal to Operators is ", a == b) # True
print("Not Equal to Operator is", a!= b) # False
print("", a > b) # False
print(a < b) # True
print(a >= b) # True

# We can also use these operators with strings
