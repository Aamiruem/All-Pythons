# Variables
# A variable is a name given to a memory location in a program.
name = "Aamir"
age = 22
price = 25.99
age2 = age + 0.5
# Print the variables
print(name, age, price)

print("This is my name: ", name)
print("This is my age: ", age)
print("This is Actual price od data in million: ", price)

# Data Types
# 1. String
# 2. Integer
# 3. Float
# 4. Boolean
# 5. List
# 6. Tuple
# 7. Dictionary
# Rules for Identifiers
# 1. Identifiers can be combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits or an underscore(_).
# So my Variable, variable_1, variable_for_print all are valid python identifiers.
# 2. An Identifier can not start with digit. So while variable1 is valid, 1variable is not valid.
# 3. We can't use special symbols like !,#,@,%,$ etc in our Identifier.
# 4. Identifier can be of any length.
# data types are used to store data in a program.
print(type(name))  # <class'str'>
print(type(age))  # <class'int'>
print(type(price))  # <class'float'>
print(type(age2))  # <class'float'>
# types of variables are defined as follows:
#
# 1. Local Variables
# 2. Global Variables
# 3. Instance Variables
# 4. Class Variables


# Data Types
# • Integers => 10, 20, 30, -100, -200, -300
# • String =>  "Hello World"
# • Float  => 3.14
# • Boolean => True or False
# • None => None is a special type of variable. It is used to represent the absence of a value.


# Keywords
# Keywords are reserved words in python.
